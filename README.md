# Personal Finance Analysis
Data analysis portfolio of personal finance management.

## Project Background
The project is a personal financial data analysis for personal financial management. This showcases the analyst's data analysis skills, programming skills, skills on extrating insights from the data, thought process, data analysis toolkits knowledge, and statistical interpretation with careful methodologies and grounded statistical inferences. The dataset was recorded daily and originally reflects the analyst's personal financial records. The project was started in 2023 and up to the recent time, and still continues to update the records, optimize pipelines and analyzation efficiency and efficacy to analyze data with the analyst's personal goal and study to further understand financial behavior, cash flow, trends, and some possible future struggles to lay-out and strategize financial management that is tied to any personal goal.

Although the full data record is private, it doesn't mean it is inaccessible. The available dataset displays only the snapshot of the owner's financial records for privacy 
and personal information disclosure. The project also doesn't withhold some personal insights gained from the analysis, this also reflects on what is
the exact steps to fully analyze the owner's financial behavior throughout the year. All the showcased findings from the analysis are all based from the dataset's snapshot details.
